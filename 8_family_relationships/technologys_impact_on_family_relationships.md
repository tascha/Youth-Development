## Technology’s impact on family relationships {#technology-s-impact-on-family-relationships}

### Mobile technologies: greater or less freedom for teens? {#mobile-technologies-greater-or-less-freedom-for-teens}

In considering adolescence as a time of greater autonomy, researchers are examining how technology supports or undermines the individuation process of teens. Researcher Sherry Turkle argues that cell phones are a “digital tether”. When parents and teens aren’t in the same physical space, parents are can still keep track of their child’s whereabouts. On the positive side, there is evidence that parents and youth are closer than ever (CITE; Katie’s lecture). However, may researchers are concerned that digital tethers like cell phones may undermine the autonomy that teens are seeking during adolescence. Still, technologies like cell phones may give youth opportunities for greater independence and mobility. For example, parents may feel more at ease with allowing their teens to take a subway alone with a cell phone in hand.

Families can also use digital media to bring them together. This is often described as joint media engagement, or viewing media like movies or playing video games together inside the home. Yet, Blackwell, Gardiner, and Schoenebeck’s (2016) research on family technology tensions finds that some devices can get in the way of family closeness. For instance, family members may use different mobile and tablet devices separately while together within the home.

### Parents&#039; rules and monitoring of social media use {#parents-rules-and-monitoring-of-social-media-use}

Blackwell, Gardiner, and Schoenebeck’s research also found that parents underestimate their teens’ social media use, including what platforms they are on and how often they use them. Parents may also be unsure of how different platforms work and find themselves challenged with mediating teen’s use of digital and networked technologies (Blackwell, Gardiner, &amp; Schoenebeck’s, 2016). In a survey from Common Sense Media (2015), tweens reported that their parents are aware of their social media use, but teens are likely to say their parents know little or nothing about what they do with social media.

Other research has found that even though parents make rules around social media use, **both teens and parents tend to break these rules** (Blackwell, Gardiner, &amp; Schoenebeck’s, 2016). For example, parents might create a rule about no phone use at the dinner table, but they themselves will not follow it. While a large percentage of parents have conversations around media use, teens often feel they are not trusted. Parents may attempt to communicate with their teens about technology, but their children feel they only tell them what not to do.

Given the challenges that parents face in the digital age, researchers and authorities have called for a reexamination of what family time means in the digital age (Blackwell, Gardiner, &amp; Schoenebeck’s, 2016). The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP)(2016) has changed its stance on limiting screen time and now recommends that parents and caregivers create a family media plan that addresses the different needs of each child and the whole family.

A few tips for parents in the digital age from the AAP include:

*   Model moderation in your own digital media use.
*   Use media with your child.
*   Know what your child is doing online.
*   Set limits.
*   Create tech free zones.

In thinking back to our section on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, it’s important to consider how technology may affect different mesosystems, or connections between environments like family and school or family and libraries. For example: What types of different messages are teens receiving from family, school, and libraries and how do they relate to one another?

Consider the contexts that don’t involve teens directly like the parent’s workplace. With parents often tied to technology for work, is their attention now divided? Or does technology offer parents with greater freedom to work inside the home and be available more for teens? Digital and networked technologies and their use inside and outside the home offer families with distinct challenges. Consistent and realistic expectations may help families effectively manage their teens’ technology use (American Association of Pediatrics, 2016; Blackwell, Gardiner, &amp; Schoenebeck, 2016).
