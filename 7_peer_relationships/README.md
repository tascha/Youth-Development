# 7\. Peer relationships {#7-peer-relationships}

In this section, we explore the nature of peer relationships during adolescence, including the critical function they play in supporting adolescent identity development. We examine how teens use networked technologies to communicate with their peers, and the impact that such mediated communication has on friendships and romantic relationships. Cyberbullying and other forms of “digital stress” will also be explored (Katie’s Lecture, 2016).
