# 2\. Key Theories of Youth Development {#2-key-theories-of-youth-development}

Youth development can be approached from many perspectives. In this section, you will be introduced to key theories of child development. In particular, we focus on:

*   Piaget’s cognitive development theory
*   Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory
*   Papert’s theory of constructionism
*   Bandura’s social cognitive learning theory
*   Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of development
*   Erikson’s psychosocial theory of human development

You can draw on these theoretical perspectives to guide the design of your youth-centered programming and services.
