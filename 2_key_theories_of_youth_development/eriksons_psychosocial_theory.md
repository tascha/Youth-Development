## Erikson’s psychosocial theory {#erikson-s-psychosocial-theory}

Erik Erikson (1902-1994) was a German psychoanalyst heavily influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud. His psychosocial theory of development emphasized viewing development over the span of a young person’s life into adulthood. He found that young people go through a series of stages that involve interaction with their social environment (Hetherington, Parke, &amp; Locke, 2003). As such, development occurs as a young person builds upon a previous stage.

### 8 different stages of psychosocial development {#8-different-stages-of-psychosocial-development}

Erikson proposed that a young person goes through 8 different stages of development marked by crises, or tensions, that must be resolved. The resolution of these crises help the child become a well-adjusted, &quot;complete&quot; adult. Attitudes, skills, and beliefs are developed at each stage. The way youth resolve these crises may determine their identity and future development.

### An identity crisis {#an-identity-crisis}

In Erikson’s stage of adolescence, self identity is a focus (Hetherington, Parke, &amp; Locke, 2003). The teenage years are seen as a crucial transition from childhood to adulthood. At this time, a young person becomes more independent, finds his own social niche, and starts to look at the future in terms of career or relationships.

Teens may grapple with the challenges of both &quot;fitting in&quot; and exploring different identities. An identity crisis may occur when he has trouble deciding his social role, who he is, or what he wants to be. According to Erikson, youth who successfully overcome this crisis may develop a clear understanding of their own identity while freely sharing who they are with others. Therefore, peers may play a large role in youth identity development.
