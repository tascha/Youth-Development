## Teens’ media use patterns and behaviors {#teens-media-use-patterns-and-behaviors}

### Key findings from media use studies: Teens ages 13-17 {#key-findings-from-media-use-studies-teens-ages-13-17}

Recent media use statistics and research coming from the [The Pew Research Center&#039;s Internet &amp; American Life Project](http://www.pewinternet.org/) have shown that mobile technologies have facilitated teen’s widespread access to daily online access (Lenhard, 2015). For instance, 91% of teens go online from mobile devices “at least occasionally” (Lenhard, 2015). As of 2015, Facebook was identified as the most popular and frequently used social platform. In examining how many followers’ teens had on Facebook, 34% did not know how many large their friend networks were. This finding may provide some insight into teens’ understanding of privacy on networked spaces.

Additionally, the Pew report identified varying uses and patterns among different teen populations. Some teens, mainly middle and upper income teens, are leading the way in moving more towards emerging platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. As visually-based, photo and video sharing platforms gain in popularity, statistics show that Facebook may be losing its dominance as the main social media service for teens.

### Teens and smartphones {#teens-and-smartphones}

The Pew report (2015) found that smartphone usage is widespread among teens of all demographics and socioeconomic statuses. This finding may show some promise as a way to bridge the digital divide for disadvantaged teens with limited internet access. With texting a common activity, the Pew report also reveals how many teens are not simply using the texting systems that telephone companies offer. Around 73% of teens with access to smartphones are using messaging apps like Kik or WhatsApp. Fully 33% of teens with phones have texting and messaging apps. Finally, texting is not the only activity; teens use their smartphones as an entertainment hub: sharing photos and videos, watching videos, playing games, listening to music.

### Common Sense Media studies: Teens ages 13-18 and Tweens ages 8-12 {#common-sense-media-studies-teens-ages-13-18-and-tweens-ages-8-12}

Teens and tweens spend a large amount of time using screen media (Common Sense Media, 2015). On average, teens spend approximately 9 hours a day using screen media, while tweens spend 6 hours (Common Sense Media, 2015). In a 2015 Common Sense media survey, tweens and teens media practices were identified by “media profiles” to describe common use patterns; including:

*   Light Users
*   Readers
*   Mobile Gamers
*   Heavy Viewers
*   Video Gamers
*   Social Networkers

Tweens and teens spend a lot of time playing mobile games, watching TV and videos, using social media, and listening to music. Nearly a quarter of tweens are considered “Video Gamers”—the largest of all six media profiles discovered. The largest media profile found for teens were the “Heavy Viewers” who spent over 16 hours a day with a form of media. Among both tweens and teens, boys and girls appear to have very different media preferences and habits. Boys were found to play more console video games and engage in less reading when compared to girls. In addition to reading more, girls spend more time on social media.

The Common Sense Media (2015) study also revealed a large “digital equity gap” as children in lower-income families are significantly less likely than their more affluent peers to live in homes with access to digital technologies(p.23). While digital media is used for reading, watching, playing, listening, communicating, and creating, few teens (only 3%) are engaged in “content creation” or actually making things online (p.23). As such, content creation activities during digital media use may be an opportunity for youth librarians. Content creation might be included in programming such as interactive media teen book clubs or video blog creation workshops (Martin, 2015).
