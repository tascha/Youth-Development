Self-esteem building for teenaged girls through STEM mentorship opportunities. Music production and filmmaking workshops to foster leadership and self-expression. Opportunities for youth to develop new literacies and engage in social interaction through video game-focused programming.

These are just a few examples of how librarians are putting research and evidence into practice through library services and programming that supports youth’s personal, social, and academic development.

In this module, we explore how youth express themselves, communicate with each other, and locate and make use of information in the digital era. With a focus on living and learning in the digital age, we present key theories and research on youth development and information behavior. In addition, we’ve included some best practices and experiences of youth librarians from around the United States.
